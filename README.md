# Fashion_Similarity_Search_Engine
It is a python project to create a similarity search engine for fashion. #SubashPalvel #subashpalvel #subash #palvel #SUBASHPALVEL


A ranked list of catalogue images that are comparable to the target catalogue image is what fashion recommendation systems are made to do. These systems play a critical role in guiding clients towards prospective purchases of suggested goods. Finding a true association between customerÂ satisfaction and recommendations for similar products can greatly enhance businesses' sales experiences. Accurately locating comparable photos for a given product image is one of the key tasks in fashion recommendation systems. To record a range of user interests, we employed a sizable dataset made up of 25 GB of image data.. The model is trained with 50 epoches to get the best results from the data we collected. The results of our model's training utilising various compilers are as follows. The local computer that we used for training has a Ryzen 550U processor and 8GB of RAM.

As can be seen from the comparison above, training a model on a local machine requires a lot of time, making it impossible for a student to complete. Nevertheless, by using cloud compilers like Google Colab and Intel OneApi, we substantially cut the time, making it easier and more accessible for students to learn AI and ML.
